Welcome to the repository for my research project titled "Real-Time Reusability Enhancement: An IDE-Integrated Approach for Modular Code in Open-Source Development." This research is being carried out under the guidance of Dr. Roopak Sinha and falls under the unit SIT723 at Deakin University. The project aims to improve the maintainability of open-source software systems by enhancing code reusability through real-time developer assistance. By integrating AI-powered tools into popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), this research seeks to provide developers with modularization suggestions that help reduce complexity and improve the long-term sustainability of their projects.

## Project Development Process

### Thesis 
This repository includes the Thesis, which documents the entire research journeyâ€”from identifying reusability challenges to proposing AI-driven solutions. The draft explains how reusability is critical to maintaining software and how integrating reusability improvements into IDEs can streamline development processes, especially in open-source environments.

### Literature Review
The **Literature Review** explores existing research on software maintainability, refactoring techniques, and architectural patterns that promote reusability. The review highlights the gaps in current practices and the absence of standardized metrics for evaluating reusability, making a case for the integration of AI and machine learning into the process.

### Research Questions
This project is structured around the following key Research Questions:

1. How can AI and large language models (LLMs) provide real-time suggestions for modularizing code to improve reusability in open-source software?
2. What challenges do developers face in enhancing reusability in open-source projects, and how can best practices address these challenges?
3. How can AI-driven modularity suggestions improve reusability in collaborative software projects, such as open-source note-taking applications?

### Proposed Solution & Architecture
The core of this research is the **Proposed Solution**: a real-time reusability suggestion tool integrated into IDEs like Visual Studio Code and PyCharm. This tool continuously analyzes the code as it is being written and provides developers with instant suggestions on how to break down their code into smaller, more reusable components. The **Architecture** section of the repository includes a detailed plan of how this tool is integrated into the developer workflow, allowing for seamless refactoring without interrupting the coding process.

### Research Methodology
A detailed **Research Methodology** outlines the experimental and survey-based approaches taken to evaluate the proposed solution. The methodology includes:

- Experimental tests on real-world open-source projects.
- Developer surveys to gather insights on the practical challenges of reusability.
- A structured plan for measuring the success of the reusability suggestions using software metrics like code modularity, cohesion, and maintainability.

This methodology ensures a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to improving reusability.
